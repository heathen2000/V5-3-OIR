The gene expression dataset (GSE289223) was retrieved from GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE289223). A total number of 6 samples were analyzed: normoxic mice postnatal 17 (3 replicates), oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) mice postnatal 17 (3 replicates). C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 75% O2 in a hyperoxic chamber from postnatal day P7 to P12 and then returned to room air. The greatest neovascular response occurred at postnatal 17 days(P17) when the mice were put back to room air condition for 5 days. The retina samples from normoxic and OIR mice were collected and performed transcriptomic analyses. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the edgeR package in R software.This analysis encompassed GO, KEGG, and GSEA. Significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the following criteria: adjusted P value < 0.05 and the |log2FC (fold change) | > 1. The expression value of VEGF and TNF-α were obtained from the series_matrix.txt of GSE289223, and then presented in dot plot.
